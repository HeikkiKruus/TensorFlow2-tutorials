"""Working with Unicode text"""


import tensorflow as tf

"""## The `tf.string` data type

The basic TensorFlow `tf.string` `dtype` allows you to build tensors of byte strings.
Unicode strings are utf-8 encoded by default.
"""

"""A `tf.string` tensor can hold byte strings of varying lengths because the byte strings are treated as atomic units. The string length is not included in the tensor dimensions."""

"""## Representing Unicode

There are two standard ways to represent a Unicode string in TensorFlow:

* `string` scalar ‚Äî where the sequence of code points is encoded using a known [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding).
* `int32` vector ‚Äî where each position contains a single code point.

For example, the following three values all represent the Unicode string `"ËØ≠Ë®ÄÂ§ÑÁêÜ"` (which means "language processing" in Chinese):
"""

# Unicode string, represented as a UTF-8 encoded string scalar.
text_utf8 = tf.constant(u"ËØ≠Ë®ÄÂ§ÑÁêÜ")

# Unicode string, represented as a UTF-16-BE encoded string scalar.
text_utf16be = tf.constant(u"ËØ≠Ë®ÄÂ§ÑÁêÜ".encode("UTF-16-BE"))

# Unicode string, represented as a vector of Unicode code points.
text_chars = tf.constant([ord(char) for char in u"ËØ≠Ë®ÄÂ§ÑÁêÜ"])

"""### Converting between representations

TensorFlow provides operations to convert between these different representations:

* `tf.strings.unicode_decode`: Converts an encoded string scalar to a vector of code points.
* `tf.strings.unicode_encode`: Converts a vector of code points to an encoded string scalar.
* `tf.strings.unicode_transcode`: Converts an encoded string scalar to a different encoding.
"""

"""### Batch dimensions

When decoding multiple strings, the number of characters in each string may not be equal.  The return result is a [`tf.RaggedTensor`](../../guide/ragged_tensors.ipynb), where the length of the innermost dimension varies depending on the number of characters in each string:
"""

# A batch of Unicode strings, each represented as a UTF8-encoded string.

### Character length

The `tf.strings.length` operation has a parameter `unit`, which indicates how lengths should be computed.  `unit` defaults to `"BYTE"`, but it can be set to other values, such as `"UTF8_CHAR"` or `"UTF16_CHAR"`, to determine the number of Unicode codepoints in each encoded `string`.

Similarly, the `tf.strings.substr` operation accepts the "`unit`" parameter, and uses it to determine what kind of offsets the "`pos`" and "`len`" paremeters contain.
"""

"""### Split Unicode strings

The `tf.strings.unicode_split` operation splits unicode strings into substrings of individual characters:
"""

tf.strings.unicode_split(thanks, 'UTF-8').numpy()

"""### Byte offsets for characters

To align the character tensor generated by `tf.strings.unicode_decode` with the original string, it's useful to know the offset for where each character begins.  The method `tf.strings.unicode_decode_with_offsets` is similar to `unicode_decode`, except that it returns a second tensor containing the start offset of each character.

"""## Unicode scripts

Each Unicode code point belongs to a single collection of codepoints known as a [script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Script_%28Unicode%29) .  A character's script is helpful in determining which language the character might be in. For example, knowing that '–ë' is in Cyrillic script indicates that modern text containing that character is likely from a Slavic language such as Russian or Ukrainian.

TensorFlow provides the `tf.strings.unicode_script` operation to determine which script a given codepoint uses. The script codes are `int32` values corresponding to [International Components for
Unicode](http://site.icu-project.org/home) (ICU) [`UScriptCode`](http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/uscript_8h.html) values.

"""## Example: Simple segmentation

Segmentation is the task of splitting text into word-like units. This is often easy when space characters are used to separate words, but some languages (like Chinese and Japanese) do not use spaces, and some languages (like German) contain long compounds that must be split in order to analyze their meaning. In web text, different languages and scripts are frequently mixed together, as in "NYÊ†™‰æ°" (New York Stock Exchange).

We can perform very rough segmentation (without implementing any ML models) by using changes in script to approximate word boundaries. This will work for strings like the "NYÊ†™‰æ°" example above. It will also work for most languages that use spaces, as the space characters of various scripts are all classified as USCRIPT_COMMON, a special script code that differs from that of any actual text.
